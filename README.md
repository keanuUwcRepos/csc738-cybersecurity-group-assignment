# CSC738_cybersecurity_assignment

The android application presented here is a **hint hunt** of the UWC CAMS building. The concept revolves around the familiarization of the building, by using hints to navigate the labs and open areas. 

This is implemented using an Android AR application to find hidden clues in images posted around the building. 

## HOW TO USE:

1. The implementation of the application starts with the installation of the apk on an Android device.
2. Pan over the initial marker, (in this case the introductory CAMS image) to find the initial clue, and use these clues to navigate to the following markers.
3. Complete all of the clues in the **hint hunt** to find the hidden video, at the end.

The proposed images are to be setup in the UWC CAMS lab, the assigned areas as described below:
